Welcome to the Wiki for the WiiRemoteControl Project.



= Details =

The WiiRemoteControl project aims to design a program that is able to transform the WiiRemote into several types of controller:
  * *IR Presentation Pointer* - A classic point and click mouse device
  * *Media Center Remote* - Use gestures to control your media
  * *Multi-'touch' HID* - Using Johnny Lee's principle of reverse IR reflection to make a hand based multi touch device
